# CSC690App
### WhiteBoard

Project Creator: Kamran Khadivi-Dimbali
Code Review Hand: Sam Flores

## Proposal

Leave chore-related arguments behind.  Passive-aggressive notes and texts are a thing of the past. Whiteboard acts as the house manager, a command center that will help roommates manage their living situations.

A user creates a household and adds his housemates to it.  The users add chores to the calendar and can customize when the chore shall be completed by.  This chore can reoccur however many times the house needs it to be done within a month.  Chores are assigned to each roommate and they will rotate week to week. Notifications are completely customizeable, so you can get multiple reminders a week or one, depending on what you prefer.  Once you complete a chore you can check it complete and everyone can see who has done what.  With this system, the app will keep track of who is pulling their weight and who is not.
